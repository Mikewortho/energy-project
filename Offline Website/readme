A guide to setting up an offline website on a local host

This is a fairly simple procedure and simply requires hosting the folder with
any HTTP hosting service. In our testing we used the built in http server
bundled with all python distributions.

Direct your command line prompt to the folder that contains the gen_data
folder, which if downloading from the latest github distribution should be
unzipped into the energy-project folder.

From here run the command

for python 2:
python -m SimpleHttpServer 8000

for python 3:
python -m http.server 8000

Then direct any modern web browser to:
localhost:8000

Then follow as per the usability document
